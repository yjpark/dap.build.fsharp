# Not know the reason, though MSBuild 16 had an issue with `dotnet restore`
#   error NU1202: Package Microsoft.Build 16.0.461 is not compatible with netstandard2.0 (.NETStandard,Version=v2.0). Package Microsoft.Build 16.0.461 supports:
#   error NU1202:   - net472 (.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2)
#   error NU1202:   - netcoreapp2.1 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.1)
#
# It's weird to me since other netstandard2.0 project don't have this issue
# I think this might be a paket issue, but not sure
# Current workaround is to specifi MSBuild 15 in dependencies
# nuget Microsoft.Build < 16

# nuget Microsoft.Build
